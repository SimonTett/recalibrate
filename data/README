Data used in recalibration. Data provided by Dr Xian Zhi (朱献 <zhux53@mail.sysu.edu.cn>) and collaborators.
Data comes from processing of HadGEM-GA6 data. These simulations were carried out by Fraser Lott at the Met Office.

For details of processing and results from Uncalibrated ensemble see:
"ANTHROPOGENIC INFLUENCES ON THE EXTREMELY DRY AND HOT SUMMER OF 2020 IN SOUTHERN CHINA" by Zheng et al.
Hopefully, accepted by BAMS for the special supplement on explaining extreme events of 2020.

File naming convention is:
{var}_model_15runs_jja_1961_2020_ts.nc -- simulated data from 1961-2013 from 15 member Historical ensemble. Netcdf file.
{var}_model_all_anom_2020.txt -- simulated HistoricalExt data for 2020. Text file.
{var}_model_nat_anom_2020.txt -- simulated HistoricalNatExt data for 2020. Text file.
{var}_obs_jja_1961_2020_ts.nc -- Observed data from 1961-2020. Netcdf file.

{var} is one of nhd (anomalous number of hot days),
tas ( anomalous air temperature) and pap (Percentage anomalous precipitation). All anomalies are relative to 1980-2010
and for SE China.
