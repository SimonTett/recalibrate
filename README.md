# recalibrate
Software and data used for recalibration work in EERCH project.

recalibrate.py is a module that provides various useful functions.

plot_reliability_SEchina.py -- computes and plots reliability diagrams (fig 1)

recalibrate_SEchina.py actually does the recalibration for data from SE China. 
   It also computes uncertainies via bootstraps. 
   This is quite slow esp for the PAP fits.

plot_recalibrate.py -- makes two of the plots in the report. (Fig2 & fig 3)


summary_plot.py plots the summary figure of PR with and without recalibration
